/*1. Difference between Class and Object

Class: A blueprint/template that defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) of something.

Object: A real instance created from a class.

Real-life example:

A Class could be Car (it defines brand, color, speed, and methods like drive or stop).

An Object is your actual Toyota Corolla (red, 180km/h) created from that class.


2. What is a Constructor? Types in Dart

A Constructor is a special method used to create and initialize objects.

Types of Constructors in Dart:

Default Constructor.

Parameterized Constructor.

Named Constructor.

Factory Constructor.


3. Access Modifiers in Dart

Dart does not have public, private, protected like Java.

Instead, it uses library-level privacy:

Any identifier starting with _ is private to its library.

Otherwise, it’s public.


4. Encapsulation in Dart

Encapsulation wrapping data and methods together while hiding implementation details.


5. Why use a Setter instead of making a variable public?

 If you make a variable public:
Anyone can directly modify it without restriction.
No validation or control.

With a setter:
You control how the value is set.
You keep the object’s data safe and consistent
